All Music Prep

All Music Prep is a web app I developed to improve music practice efficiency for students. It combines my experience in piano with my interest in programming to create a tool that supports self-paced learning and progress tracking.

Motivation

The schoolâ€™s music learning website only offered basic exercises, which limited student engagement and the depth of practice. I wanted to create a more interactive and flexible platform that could accommodate individual learning needs.

Features

AI Q&A Interface: Responds to music-related queries, enabling students to grasp concepts quickly.

Customizable Practice: Users can set the number of questions and track their accuracy and completion time.

Progress Monitoring: Students can measure their improvement over time.

Challenges and Solutions

One major challenge was integrating audio files. After trying multiple libraries and installation methods, I was unable to implement this feature. However, this led me to develop command-line scripts that automated repetitive tasks, reducing workflow time by nearly 80%.

Reflection

This project taught me how to transform an idea into a functional tool that supports others. It strengthened my coding skills and gave me satisfaction in thoughtful design, problem-solving, and iterative development.
