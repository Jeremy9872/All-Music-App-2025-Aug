**All Music Prep** is an **unpublished app** I developed to improve **music practice efficiency and independent learning** for students.
It combines my experience in **piano learning** with my interest in **coding** to create a tool that supports **self-paced learning** and **progress tracking**.

## ðŸš€ Motivation
The school's music learning website offered only basic functions, which limited engagement, lacked appeal, and provided only a few practices for users.
I wanted to build a **more interactive and flexible platform** that allows students to practice precisely the areas they want to improve.




## âœ¨ Features 
- **Logo** â†’ I designed it by myself
- **Interface Design** â†’ Use earth-tone color to make the user feel relaxed while interacting with interfaces
- **Customizable Practice** â†’ Users can set the number of questions they want to do, avoid prolonged practicing, which can lead to decreased concentration and waste of time
- **Progress Tracking** â†’ Accuracy and time monitoring for self-paced learning, user will be able to stay on track of their improvement
- **AI Q&A Interface** â†’ Connected to an outside AI model, so it takes some time to answer the users' requests. I am learning how to remodel it to become a real music knowledge assistant




## ðŸ’¡ Reflection and takeaways
This project taught me how to turn an **idea into a functional tool** that supports others. 
I gained skills in **coding, problem-solving, and thoughtful design**.  
Most importantly, I learned the value of **combining creativity and technical skills** to make a real impact.
