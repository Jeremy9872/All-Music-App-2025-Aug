# ðŸŽµ All Music Prep 

**All Music Prep** is a **web app** I developed to improve **music practice efficiency** for students.  
It combines my experience in **piano** with my interest in **programming** to create a tool that supports **self-paced learning** and **progress tracking**.  

---

## ðŸš€ Motivation
The schoolâ€™s **music learning website** only offered *basic exercises*, which limited engagement.  
I wanted to build a **more interactive and flexible platform** that adapts to different learning needs.  




## âœ¨ Features 
- **AI Q&A Interface** â†’ Responds only to music-related queries  
- **Customizable Practice** â†’ Users can set the number of questions  
- **Progress Tracking** â†’ Accuracy and time monitoring for self-paced learning  




## âš¡ Challenges and Solutions
One major challenge was **audio integration**.  
Despite testing multiple libraries, I could not implement it.  
However, this led me to build **command-line scripts** that automated repetitive tasks,  
cutting workflow time by nearly **80%**.  




## ðŸ’¡ Reflection
This project taught me how to turn an **idea into a functional tool** that supports others.  
I gained skills in **coding, problem-solving, and thoughtful design**.  
Most importantly, I learned the value of **combining creativity and technical skills** to make a real impact.
