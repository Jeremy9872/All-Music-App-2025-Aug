This project showcases my passions for music, coding, and learning, as well as communication, conception, and the accomplishment that comes from solving problems with purpose.

I was initially motivated by the limited functionality of the music learning website used in school music class, which only offered basic knowledge exercises. Combining my musical background and my interest in programming, I created this app, hoping to help students learn more efficiently. My teacher recommended this project for the Arizona Seal of Arts Proficiency, an award that recognizes students who make meaningful contributions across multiple disciplines.

The app's features were tailored through discussions with our school music teacher. I implemented an AI Q&A interface and tried to train it to respond only to music-related queries. Additionally, I enhanced some aspects of the old site, including allowing users to set the number of questions and track their accuracy and time. This way, students could self-pace and measure their progress.

One memorable challenge was integrating audio files. Despite trying several libraries and installation methods, I ultimately couldn't implement them, but the process led me to discover the efficiency of using terminal scripts. I ended up writing a command-line tool that automated my workflow, cutting modification time by nearly 80%.

While coding is just an interest, what truly excites me is knowing how I can combine my interest and expertise to support others. In addition to the excitement of resolving all 126 errors at once, I find satisfaction in the thoughtful design that brings my vision to life. I am, and will always, carry this spirit as I continue exploring the knowledge I seek.
