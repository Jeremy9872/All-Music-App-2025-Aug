### Demonstration vedio: https://youtu.be/o9Zw6ClK2_o 

**All Music Prep** is an **unpublished app** I developed to improve **music practice efficiency and independent learning** for students.
This project shows my ability to turn an idea into a practical solution, combining my experience in **piano learning** with my interest in **coding** to create a tool that supports **self-paced learning** and **progress tracking**. During the app-making process, I **communicated extensively with AI**, layered my ideas into multiple layers to make it easier for AI to understand. Combining what I learned in school, I successfully created a product that was close to my vision.

## ðŸš€ Motivation
The school's music learning website offered only basic functions, which limited engagement, lacked appeal, and provided only a few practices for users.
I wanted to build a **more interactive and flexible platform** that allows students to practice precisely the areas they want to improve.




## âœ¨ Features 
- **Logo** â†’ I designed it from ideas of my own :)
- **Interface Design** â†’ Use earth-tone color to make the user feel relaxed while interacting with interfaces
- **Customizable Practice** â†’ Users can set the number of questions they want to do, avoid prolonged practicing, which can lead to decreased concentration and waste of time
- **Answer Report** â†’ Accuracy and time monitoring for self-paced learning, user will be able to stay on track of their improvement
- **AI Q&A Interface** â†’ I suddenly had an idea that AI's resilience could make up for my lack of teaching resources and solve the problem of whether students could answer questions in the teaching materials I provided during their use. Therefore, I added this AI Q&A function midway. This interface is connected to an external AI model, which means it requires more time to respond than other AI models, such as GPT and DeepSeek. I am learning how to build artificial intelligence from scratch and will apply it to my system design in the future.




## ðŸ’¡ Reflection and takeaways

I gained skills in **coding, problem-solving, and thoughtful design**. Most importantly, I learned the value of **combining creativity and technical skills** to make a real impact.
